        <h5>COMMENTS</h5>
        <p>When visitors leave comments on the site we collect the data shown in the comments form, and also the
            visitor’s IP address and browser user agent string to help spam detection.
            <br> <br>
            An anonymized string created from your email address (also called a hash) may be provided to the Gravatar
            service to see if you are using it. The Gravatar service privacy policy is available here:
            https://automattic.com/privacy/. After approval of your comment, your profile picture is visible to the
            public in the context of your comment.
        </p>
        <h5>MEDIA</h5>
        <p>If you upload images to the website, you should avoid uploading images with embedded location data (EXIF GPS)
            included. Visitors to the website can download and extract any location data from images on the website.</p>
        <h5>CONTACT FORMS</h5>
        <h5>COOKIES</h5>
        <p>If you leave a comment on our site you may opt-in to saving your name, email address and website in cookies.
            These are for your convenience so that you do not have to fill in your details again when you leave another
            comment. These cookies will last for one year.
            <br><br>
            If you visit our login page, we will set a temporary cookie to determine if your browser accepts cookies.
            This cookie contains no personal data and is discarded when you close your browser.
            <br><br>
            When you log in, we will also set up several cookies to save your login information and your screen display
            choices. Login cookies last for two days, and screen options cookies last for a year. If you select
            “Remember Me”, your login will persist for two weeks. If you log out of your account, the login cookies will
            be removed.
            <br><br>
            If you edit or publish an article, an additional cookie will be saved in your browser. This cookie includes
            no personal data and simply indicates the post ID of the article you just edited. It expires after 1 day.

        <h5>EMBEDDED CONTENT FROM OTHER WEBSITES</h5>
        <p>Articles on this site may include embedded content (e.g. videos, images, articles, etc.). Embedded content
            from other websites behaves in the exact same way as if the visitor has visited the other website.
            <br><br>
            These websites may collect data about you, use cookies, embed additional third-party tracking, and monitor
            your interaction with that embedded content, including tracking your interaction with the embedded content
            if you have an account and are logged in to that website.

            HOW LONG WE RETAIN YOUR DATA

        <p>If you leave a comment, the comment and its metadata are retained indefinitely. This is so we can recognize
            and approve any follow-up comments automatically instead of holding them in a moderation queue.
            <br><br>
            For users that register on our website (if any), we also store the personal information they provide in
            their user profile. All users can see, edit, or delete their personal information at any time (except they
            cannot change their username). Website administrators can also see and edit that information.

            the personal data we hold about you, including any data you have provided to us. You can also request that
            we erase any personal data we hold about you. This does not include any data we are obliged to keep for
